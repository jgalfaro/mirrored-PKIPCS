# PKI-PCS

This repository contains the proof-of-concept functionality of PKI-PCS, a PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) management system for 
securing e-assessment systems according to the General Data Protection Regulation ([GDPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation)). It extends the certification features of traditional PKIs by allowing privacy-preserving attribute credentials. This offers the possibility of learners to authenticate with verifiers in a pseudonymous manner. See [here](http://www-public.tem-tsp.eu/~garcia_a/web/papers/preprint-iv2017.pdf) and [here](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-67816-0), for further details.
